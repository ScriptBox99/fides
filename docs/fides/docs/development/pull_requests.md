# Pull Requests

---

Pull Requests are the primary unit of work within the Fidesctl project. All code changes are expected to be submitted via a PR, and as such here are a few requirements for submitting PRs:

1. Completely fill out the provided pull request template.
1. PRs should be in a `draft` state until they are ready for a final review + merge. A non-draft PR signals to the community that the author believes the PR is ready to ship!
1. Make sure that all checks are passing and all boxes have been checked before taking the PR out of a `draft` state. PR reviews require other people to spend their time, so please be courteous and double check your work before passing it to a reviewer.
1. If you're unsure about a potential feature implementation or there is anything else that needs discussing, feel free to ask for an early review/feedback in the comments of the PR.
1. If a PR is too large in scope, consider breaking it up into multiple smaller PRs. Large PRs are much harder to validate, test and review. This makes them much riskier to merge.
